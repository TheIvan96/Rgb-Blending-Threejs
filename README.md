# RGB Blending Three Js

This is an Angular v15 + three.js project where you can blend red, green and blue rgb colors drag and drop little sphere into
a big sphere. This is my first three.js project and it's done to learn how to programm with this 3D js library.

## Demo

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
